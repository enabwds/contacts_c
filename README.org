* Contact Management System

** Overview
This program is a Contact Management System implemented in C. It allows users to manage a list of contacts, including functionalities such as adding, editing, searching, sorting, and deleting contacts. The contacts are stored in a CSV file for persistence.

** Features
- Add new contacts.

- Search for a contact by name.
- Edit an existing contact's details.
- Delete a contact by name.
- Save and load contacts to/from a CSV file.
- Prevents duplicate contacts.
- Automatically sorts contacts alphabetically by name.

** How to Build
To compile the program, use a C compiler such as `gcc` or `clang`:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gcc -o contact_manager main.c
#+END_SRC

Make sure to include the file `error_codes.h` in the same directory as the source file.

** How to Run
After compiling, run the program with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./contact_manager
#+END_SRC

   - `4`: Edit a contact's details.
   - `5`: Delete a contact by name.
   - `6`: Save and exit the program.

2. Contacts are stored in `contacts.csv` for persistence between runs.

** File Structure
- **contact_manager.c**: The main source code file containing the program logic.
- **error_codes.h**: A header file that defines error codes used in the program.
- **contacts.csv**: The default file used to store contacts.
